Maven Installation Procedure:
==========================
STEP 1.First we need to check java is intalled or not in the server by using below command

java --version or java -version 

if not installed please install using "yum install open-jdk-1.8.0"
STEP 2.Then we need to check for javacompiler is installed or not by using below command.

javac --version by using "yum install java-1.8.0-amazon-corretto-devel.x86_64"
STEP 3. Then we need to install Maven using below command

first change directory using cd /opt

wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/maven/maven-3/3.9.2/binaries/apache-maven-3.9.2-bin.tar.gz
Then
we have to unzip it using below command
 tar -xvzf apache-maven-3.9.2-bin.tar.gz
 
Till now we have install maven but we have not configure it, so we need to configure Maven.

"apache-maven-3.9.2-bin.tar.gz" --->after unzip apache-maven-3.9.2

above file consist of all commands of maven so we need to make sure these commands can be understandable by server.

Maven Configurations:

STEP 4. Now set the maven location to one environment variable so that any third party apps can use this variable for easy access. use below command.

export M2_HOME=/opt/apache-maven-3.9.2
STEP 5.Now we need to set the PATH of the maven bin to PATH of the server like below

export PATH=$PATH:$M2_HOME/bin

use env command to check both PATH and M2_HOME variables set or not. if set PATH command will show like below

PATH=/root/.local/bin:/root/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/var/lib/snapd/snap/bin:/opt/apache-maven-3.9.2/bin.

STEP 6. Now you check maven is present in the server or not using the command "mvn -version"
STEP 7. Now to set up project architecture in maven use below command

mvn archetype:generate
after you enter this command we need to select project type like number :2051
and then we need to select groupID like com.xyz.www
and then we need to select artifact id
and then we need to select version
and then we need to select project.

Then click ok. your project structure has build and now you can give this project to developer.
STEP 8.go to the location wherever you have installed POM file then use below commands.
mvn validate ---> it will show if build has any errors
mvn compile ---> to make .java file to .class file
mvn test ---> to test the testcases by developer
mvn package ---> it will package the entire code to .jar file

Congratulations, you have installed, configured and used Maven to make our project build success.
